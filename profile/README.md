## Inspirations

- Discworld MUD
- Kingsway
- Ragnarok Online

## Workflow

- I want to keep the process simple by allowing anyone to quickly start the game with a double-click on an `index.html` file.
  - This ensures that playing or testing the toys doesnâ€™t require complex setups or server-side dependencies.

## Tech

### Client-side

- TypeScript
  - Transpiled to IIFE JavaScript

### Reusable Modules

- TypeScript
  - Exported as ES module
